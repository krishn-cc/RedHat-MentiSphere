❌ The Problem

In today’s student life, learners face:
Stress & Anxiety – Exams, deadlines, and uncertainty about the future.
Isolation – Loneliness and lack of safe spaces to share struggles.
Stigma & Inaccessibility – Hesitation to seek professional help due to fear of judgment, high cost, or limited access.
Unengaging Solutions – Existing wellness apps feel too clinical, impersonal, or fail to keep students motivated.
